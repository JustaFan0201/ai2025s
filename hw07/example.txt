Review the results of splitting the long text into several short texts.

 GPT or Generative Pre-trained Transformer is a large language model, or an LLM,

that can generate human-like text.  I've been using GPT in its various forms for

years.  In this video, we are going to, number one, ask, what is an LLM?  Number

two, we are going to describe how they work.  And then number three, we're going

to ask, what are the business applications of LLMs?  So let's start with number

one. What is a large language model?  Well, a large language model is an

instance of something else called a

foundation model.  Now, foundation models are pre-trained on large amounts of

unlabeled and self-supervised data,  meaning the model learns from patterns in

the data in a way that produces generalizable and adaptable output.  And large

language models are instances of foundation models applied specifically to text

and text-like things.  I'm talking about things like code.  Now, large language

models are trained on large data sets of text, such as books, articles, and

conversations.  And look, when we say


========== The 3-rd segment of the split (512 words) ==========


large, these models can be tens of gigabytes in size and trained on enormous

amounts of text data.  We're talking potentially petabytes of data here.  So to

put that into perspective, a text file that is, let's say, one gigabyte in size,

that can store about 178 million words, a lot of words just in one GB.  And how

many gigabytes are in a petabyte?  Well, it's about one million. Yeah, that's

truly a lot of tech.  Now, LLMs are also among the biggest models when it comes

to parameter count.  A parameter is

a value the model can change independently as it learns.  And the more

parameters a model has, the more complex it can be.  GTP3, for example, is pre-

trained on a corpus of actually 45 terabytes of data.  And it uses 175 billion

ML parameters.  All right. So how do they work?  Well, we can think of it like

this.  LLM equals three things, data, architecture, and lastly, we can think of

it as training.  Those three things are really the components of an LLM.  Now,

we've already discussed the enormous amounts


========== The 5-th segment of the split (508 words) ==========


of text data that goes into these things.  As for the architecture, this is a

neural network.  And for GPT, that is a transformer.  And the transformer

architecture enables the model to handle sequences of data like sentences or

lines of code.  And transformers are designed to understand the context of each

word in a sentence  by considering it in relation to every other word.  This

allows the model to build a comprehensive understanding of the sentence

structure  and the meaning of the words within it.

And then this architecture is trained on all of this large amount of data.  Now,

during training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sentence.  So

the sky is, it starts off with a random guess.  The sky is bug.  But with each

iteration, the model adjusts its internal parameters to reduce the difference

between its predictions and the actual outcomes.  The model keeps doing this,

gradually improving its word predictions  until it can reliably generate

coherent sentences.  Forget about bug.  It

can figure out its blue.  Now, the model can be fine-tuned on a smaller, more

specific data set.  Here, the model refines its understanding to be able to

perform the specific task more accurately.  Fine-tuning is what allows a general

language model to become an expert at a specific task.  Okay, so how does this

all fit into number three, business applications?  Well, for customer service

applications, businesses can use LLMs to create intelligent chatbots  that can

handle a variety of customer queries,

freeing up human agents for more complex issues.  Another good field, content

creation.  That can benefit from LLMs, which can help generate articles, emails,

social media posts,  and even YouTube video scripts.  There's an idea.  Now,

LLMs can even contribute to software development.  And they can do that by

helping to generate and review code.  And look, that's just scratching the

surface.  As large language models continue to evolve, we're bound to discover

more innovative applications.  And that's why

I'm so enamored with large language models.
